# Aria Labels

`labels` provides the ability to localize all aria-labels in the calendar for accessibility.

Below is a list of all default aria-labels.

```ts
new Calendar('#calendar', {
  labels: {
    application: 'Calendar',
    navigation: 'Calendar Navigation',
    arrowNext: {
      month: 'Next month',
      year: 'Next list of years',
    },
    arrowPrev: {
      month: 'Previous month',
      year: 'Previous list of years',
    },
    month: 'Select month, current selected month:',
    months: 'List of months',
    year: 'Select year, current selected year:',
    years: 'List of years',
    week: 'Days of the week',
    weekNumber: 'Numbers of weeks in a year',
    dates: 'Dates in the current month',
    selectingTime: 'Selecting a time ',
    inputHour: 'Hours',
