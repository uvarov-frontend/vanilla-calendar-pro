# Manual Localization

You can manually localize the calendar if the `locale` parameter does not meet your needs. Only the month and day labels in the calendar need to be localized, so you need to provide the corresponding arrays of strings and set `locale` to `'define'`.

<Info>
  Please note that the week array should start with Sunday; this does not affect **ISO 8601**.
