# Date Selection in Input

If you need to display a calendar when clicking on an **«Input»**, you can easily configure it by initializing it with the <a href="/docs/reference/main/main-settings#input">`input`</a> parameter.
Here's a simple example of usage with default parameters:

<Info>
	Open the sandbox in a separate tab to see the example with all the files. To do this, click the **«Открыть»"** button in the upper right corner.
</Info>

<Sandbox example="additional-features-date-picker-in-input" height={470} input="#calendar-input" />

It's important to note that the **«Input»** in the context of this calendar does not necessarily have to be an `<input>` tag. It can be any HTML element, such as a `<div>`.

<Sandbox example="additional-features-date-picker-in-input-div" height={470} input="#calendar-input" />

With the calendar type set to `'multiple'`, users can select multiple dates simultaneously.
This allows for easily defining date ranges and working with them.
Such a calendar provides flexibility and various options for date management.

<Sandbox example="additional-features-date-picker-in-input-multiple" vertically={false} height={760} input="#calendar-input" />
