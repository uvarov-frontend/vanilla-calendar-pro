# Multiple

The calendar type `'multiple'` displays multiple months, allowing you to select days in each of them. This calendar type is useful when a user needs to choose multiple dates in different months, but for this, you need to use the `selectionDatesMode` parameter and set its value to `'multiple'`.

Example code for creating a calendar with the type `'multiple'`.

<Sandbox example="type-of-calendar-multiple" vertically={false} height={680} />

If you need to select date ranges in each month, you can use the `selectionDatesMode` parameter and set its value to `'multiple-ranged'`. This allows you to select date ranges, not just individual days.

<Sandbox example="type-of-calendar-multiple-ranged" vertically={false} height={680} />
