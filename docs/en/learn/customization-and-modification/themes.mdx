# Themes

The calendar supports both light and dark theme designs.

If the `themeAttrDetect` parameter is set to `false`, the theme will be determined by the user's system settings or the `selectedTheme` parameter.

The calendar can automatically detect and track the site's theme based on the set tag and attribute. Additional information about this parameter can be found in the <a href="/docs/reference/additionally/settings#visibility-themeDetect">reference</a>.

If your site supports only one theme or you want to customize the calendar's appearance according to your preferences, you can explicitly choose one of the available themes.

The example below demonstrates the forced use of the dark theme.

<Sandbox example="customization-and-modification-themes-dark" themeDetection={false} />

And here's the same example, but using the light theme.

<Sandbox example="customization-and-modification-themes-light" themeDetection={false} />
